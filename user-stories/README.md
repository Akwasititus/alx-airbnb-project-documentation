# User Stories Directory

This directory contains the user stories for the **Airbnb Clone Backend Project**.

## Files
- **user-stories.md**: Contains the documented user stories derived from the use case diagram.

## Purpose
The user stories translate use case interactions into actionable development requirements. They guide the backend implementation by highlighting:
- What the user wants to achieve
- Why they need the feature
- Who benefits from it

## Coverage
The user stories cover:
1. **User Management** (registration, login, profile updates)
2. **Property Management** (listing, editing, deleting)
3. **Booking System** (search, booking, managing reservations)
4. **Payments** (secure transactions)
5. **Reviews** (guest feedback)
6. **Administration** (user and property oversight)

These stories ensure that the backend supports all critical operations for Guests, Hosts, and Admins.
